# SEQUENCE DETECTOR
A sequence detector that detects the sequence **{1,1,0,1,1,0}** from a serial input. The output can be 1-bit to denote whether the
sequence was detected or not. Taking the overlapping case in account.

*CPLD is used to implement this logic*.

Following Steps were used to implement this logic:

>1. Make State Diagram ( Moore Implementation )
>2. Infer the State Table from Step 1
>3. Write the State Equation
>4. Write the Code
